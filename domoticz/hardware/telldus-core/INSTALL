Unpacking
---------

Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	cd /usr/src
	gunzip telldus-core-{version}.tar.gz #Change {version} to the downloaded version
	tar xvf telldus-core-{version}.tar

This creates the directory /usr/src/telldus-core-{version} containing the files
from the archive. We only support the GNU version of tar archiving utility. Note
on some systems it is called gtar.

Configuring
-----------

Telldus Core is built using CMake (http://www.cmake.org), version 2.4.0 is the
minimum required version. This means there is no configure-script, but you
need to run cmake.

To configure telldus-core for your machine type:

	cmake .

in the package directory.

By default, Telldus Core is configured for installation in the /usr/local
directory, but this can be changed by using the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
option. Alternatively, the DESTDIR="/opt" option can be used to specify a "local"
installation within the source directory when running "make install".

Building
--------

To create the library and compile all the tools type:

	make

If you did not configure Telldus Core using the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
option, you need to install the library and tools in the appropriate place. To
do this, type:

	su -c "make install"

and enter the root password.

If you want to install in another directory, type:

	su -c "make DESTDIR=/opt install"

Note that on some systems the make utility is named differently, e.g. gmake.
